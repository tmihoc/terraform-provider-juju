## Create an offer
> Who: User with {ref}`offer `admin` <1150md>` access.

To create an offer, in your Terraform plan, create a resource of the `juju_offer` type, specifying the offering model and the name of the application and application endpoint from which the offer is created:

```terraform

resource "juju_offer" "percona-cluster" {
  model            = juju_model.development.name
  application_name = juju_application.percona-cluster.name
  endpoint         = server
}

```

## Integrate with an offer
> Who: User with [offer `consume`+ <1150md>` access.

To integrate with an offer, in your Terraform plan create a `juju_integration` resource as usual by specifying two application blocks and a `lifecycle > replace_triggered_by` block, but for the application representing the offer specify the `offer_url`, and in the `lifecycle` block list triggers only for the regular application (not the offer). For example:

```terraform
resource "juju_integration" "wordpress-db" {
  model = juju_model.development-destination.name

  application {
    name     = juju_application.wordpress.name
    endpoint = "db"
  }

  application {
    offer_url = juju_offer.this.url
  }

lifecycle {
    replace_triggered_by = [
      juju_application.wordpress.name,
      juju_application.wordpress.model,
      juju_application.wordpress.constraints,
      juju_application.wordpress.placement,
      juju_application.wordpress.charm.name,
    ]
  }

}

```

## Allow traffic from an integrated offer
> Who: User with [offer `admin` <1150md>` access.

To allow traffic from an integrated offer, in your Terraform plan, in the resource definition where you define the integration with an offer, use the `via` attribute to specify the list of CIDRs for outbound traffic. For example:



```terraform
resource "juju_integration" "this" {
...
  via   = "10.0.0.0/24,10.0.1.0/24"

# the rest of your integration definition

}

```

The `python-libjuju` client does not support this. Please use the `juju` client.

## Remove an offer
> Who: User with [offer `admin` <1150md>` access.

To remove an offer, in your Terraform plan, remove its resource definition.
